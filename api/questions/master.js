    #NaN <= 100# and #NaN > 100# are #false# so if the value of x is #NaN# the statements are not the same. The same holds true for any value of x that being converted to #Number#, returns #NaN#.\n
    #undefined || [1,2,5] || { a:22 } // etc#
    \nThis is why you need to pay attention when you deal with numeric variables. #NaN# canâ€™t be equal, less than or more than any other numeric value, so the only reliable way to check if the value is #NaN# is to use #isNaN()#.

    The code above will output: #undefined, 5000$# because of hoisting. You might be expecting #salary# to retain its value from the outer scope until the point that #salary# was redeclared in the inner scope. But due to hoisting, #salary# was #undefined# instead. To better understand it, have a look at the following code. Here #salary# is hoisted and declared at the top inside the function scope. When we print its value using #console.log# the result is #undefined#. Afterwards the variable is redeclared and the new value #"5000$"# is assigned to it.
